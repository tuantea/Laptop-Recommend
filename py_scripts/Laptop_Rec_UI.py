'''
Overview: User-input interface for laptops they should be recommended.

Details:
-User is given an initial prompt (a greeting + a brief introduction)
-User wants a laptop that bests suits their needs.
-Each prompt would slowly break down various questions regarding different computer specifications (e.g. memory, screen size).
-There would be no more than 5-10 questions.
-Program offers a list of suggestions from database based on user specs.

Implementation Details:
-Create functions for different categories of laptop specs
-Establish global variables that could act as flags based on user input
-Use nested conditional statements under an if-else statement that divides the program between new and experienced computer users (i.e. if? new#1: else? exp#2).
-Keep track of how many people used this program via a counter system in the greeting code.
